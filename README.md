Project: Rule-Based Decision Engine (Backend)

Overview:
This project is a Spring Boot backend service that evaluates structured input data against a configurable set of deterministic business rules and returns an explainable decision.
The system is designed to mimic enterprise decision engines used in regulated environments where decisions must be auditable, deterministic, and transparent, such as loan approvals, risk classification, or access control.

Problem This Service Solves:
Many business decisions cannot rely on black-box AI models due to compliance, regulatory, or trust constraints.

This service provides:
Fully deterministic rule evaluation
Clear decision outcomes
Human-readable explanations for every decision
Configurable rules without code changes
